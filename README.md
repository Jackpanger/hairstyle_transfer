# Hairstyle Transfer between Face Images (FG 2021)

We propose a neural network which takes two inputs, a hair image and a face image, and produces an output image having the hair of the hair image seamlessly merged with the inner face of the face image. Our architecture consists of neural networks mapping the input images into a latent code of a pretrained StyleGAN2 which generates the output high-definition image. We propose an algorithm for training parameters of the architecture solely from synthetic images generated by the StyleGAN2 itself without the need of any annotations or external dataset of hairstyle images. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in applications including hair-style transfer, hair generation for 3D morphable models, and hair-style interpolation. Fidelity of the generated images is verified by a user study and by a novel hairstyle metric proposed in the paper.
